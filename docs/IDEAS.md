_What should parkerferguson.xyz sound like? Capture thoughts here._

- Not a resume. Not LinkedIn. Not corporate.

- Self-aware without being self-deprecating. Confident without being a douchebag.
- Show the work, not just the results. The messy middle is interesting.
- OK to be weird. The weird stuff is what makes it memorable.
