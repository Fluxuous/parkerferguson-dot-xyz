## 90-Day Action Plan

### Month 1: Foundation (Days 1–30)
_Get the site live with enough content that it's worth visiting._

**Week 1–2: Deploy & Core Content**
- [ ] Update DNS, get parkerferguson.xyz live on Vercel
- [ ] Write the About page (all three tiers)
- [ ] Write the Now page (first version)
- [ ] Populate Projects with real descriptions

**Week 3–4: Start Writing**
- [ ] Publish first real blog post
- [ ] Seed the Links page with 5-10 recommendations
- [ ] Update social profiles to point to .xyz
- [ ] Share the site with close network for feedback

**Month 1 Success Metric:** Site is live, has real content on every page, and you've told at least 10 people about it.

### Month 2: Content Momentum (Days 31–60)
_Build the habit. Doesn't have to be polished._

- [ ] Publish 2-3 blog posts (aim for one every ~10 days)
- [ ] Update the Now page
- [ ] Add new links as you find them
- [ ] Set up analytics (Plausible or Vercel Analytics)
- [ ] Submit to Google Search Console
- [ ] Evaluate: is the Links page useful or just noise?

**Content Strategy:**
- Mix of post lengths: one longer essay, one medium piece, one quick note/TIL
- Don't wait until it's perfect — ship drafts, iterate in public
- Cross-post to one other platform (LinkedIn? Medium? Dev.to?) with canonical back to .xyz

**Month 2 Success Metric:** 5+ pieces of content live. You've shared at least 2 posts externally. Analytics baseline established.

### Month 3: Expand & Refine (Days 61–90)
_Polish what's working, cut what isn't._

- [ ] Publish 2-3 more posts
- [ ] Review analytics: what's getting traffic? What's not?
- [ ] Design polish pass (colors, typography, OG images)
- [ ] Port hover-preview feature from old site
- [ ] Evaluate subdomain strategy: any projects ready to host?
- [ ] Decide on newsletter: yes/no/later
- [ ] Consider a /uses or /reading page if it fits

**Month 3 Success Metric:** Regular publishing rhythm established. At least one post that got external traction. Clear view of what content resonates.

## Anti-Goals

_Things this site is explicitly NOT trying to do._

- Not trying to go viral or chase traffic
- Not trying to be a "personal brand" in the influencer sense
- Not trying to sell anything (that's what .co is for)
- Not trying to be comprehensive — curated > exhaustive
- Not optimizing for engagement metrics — optimizing for "would I be proud to show this to someone I respect?"

---

## Open Strategic Questions

_Decisions that don't need to be made today but should be made eventually._

- [ ] How public do I want to be? Full name + face, or more pseudonymous for some projects?
- [ ] Is there a community angle here, or is this purely a broadcast site?
- [ ] Should I offer anything free (templates, tools, guides) to build an email list?
- [ ] How does this relate to any future product / startup / venture?
- [ ] What's the relationship between writing here and writing on other platforms?
