## How Parker Actually Writes

### Sentence structure
- Short declarative sentences are the backbone. "I'm in. Let's do this."
- Mixes short punchy fragments with longer flowing sentences. Irregular rhythm.
- Not afraid of one-sentence paragraphs.
- Uses ALL CAPS headers to break up longer emails into scannable sections.
- Numbered lists and bold text for structure in longer messages.

### Word choice
- Plain, direct language. Says "get" not "obtain." Says "figure out" not "determine."
- Concrete and specific — leads with numbers, names, outcomes. "$45K investment, $269K in projected annual savings, payback in under 3 months."
- Uses "excited" genuinely and frequently. Not a verbal tic — he actually means it.
- "Happy to" as an offer pattern: "Happy to jump on a quick call."
- Contractions always: I'm, that's, let's, I'd, we'd, don't.

### Punctuation and formatting
- Occasional double spaces after periods (old typing habit).
- Commas are loose — sometimes comma splices, sometimes missing. Not precious about it.
- Uses bold and caps for emphasis rather than italics or em-dashes.
- Em-dashes are rare in his actual writing. Periods and commas do the work.

### Greetings and closings
- Professional: "Hi [Name]," or "[Name]," — then "Best, Parker"
- Warm/casual: "Hey [Name]," — then more personal sign-offs
- Often drops straight into content after the greeting. No throat-clearing.

### Professional register
The MG Partners proposal is the gold standard for Parker's professional voice:
> "The attached deck walks through everything: who I am, the pain points we
> identified, how I'd solve them, and what it would cost. The short version:
> $45K investment, $269K in projected annual savings, payback in under 3 months."

Characteristics: direct, specific, numbers up front, "the short version" as a framing device, clear next step at the end.

### Creative/personal register
With people he's close to, he's expressive, warm, and unguarded:
> "I'm really excited. I'm so grateful to have you in my life and so honored
> by your trust. We are aligned and on mission. Movement."

He leads with feeling, uses short emphatic fragments, and isn't afraid to be earnest.

### Professional outreach
When reaching out to new contacts:
> "Sanford, it's a pleasure to meet you. I'm excited to learn more about your
> AI incubations lab and the companies you're working with."

Clean, warm, direct. Gets to the point fast. "I'm excited to learn more" not "I would be delighted to explore the opportunity to discuss."

## Patterns to replicate in site copy

1. **Lead with the specific, not the abstract.** Numbers, names, projects — not feelings about feelings.
2. **Short sentences carry weight.** "I'm in. Let's do this." is peak Parker.
3. **Use periods, not em-dashes.** Break a thought into two sentences rather than connecting with a dash.
4. **"The short version:" as a framing device** — he naturally does tiered depth.
5. **Contractions always.** Never "I am" when "I'm" works.
6. **"Happy to" / "Looking forward to"** — his natural way of opening doors.
7. **Caps and bold for structure** in longer content, not clever transitions.
8. **Earnest without being sentimental.** He says what he means plainly.
9. **Drops into content fast.** No preamble, no throat-clearing, no "in this post I'll be discussing."

## Patterns to avoid (not Parker)

- Em-dashes as primary connective tissue
- "I'm drawn to" / "I care deeply about" / "There's something deeply satisfying"
- Parallel lists of three with balanced rhythm
- Philosophical abstractions when concrete details would do
- Self-conscious meta-commentary about the act of writing or sharing
- Overly crafted "writerly" sentences
- Starting multiple consecutive sentences with "I"

## Token/compute estimate for deeper analysis

- Gmail account has sent emails going back to at least 2019, likely further
- A focused analysis of 50-100 substantive emails (filtering out scheduling, forwards, one-liners) would give a thorough voice model
- Estimated at ~100-200K tokens of input to read and analyze that volume
- The sample above (6 emails read in full) already captures the core patterns
- Recommendation: the above analysis is likely sufficient for copy editing purposes. A deeper pass would yield diminishing returns unless you want to do something more sophisticated like fine-tuning or building a formal style guide.
