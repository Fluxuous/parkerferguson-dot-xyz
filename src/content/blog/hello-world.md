I wanted a place on the internet that's mine. Not a social profile, not a platform someone else controls. A place to share what I'm building and what I'm learning, on my own terms.

So I built one.

I have a [consulting site](https://parkerferguson.co) that does a specific job. It says "here's what I can do for you." But there's a whole layer underneath that. The projects. The experiments. The tools I'm building for myself that might be useful to other people. The ideas that don't fit in a pitch deck. That stuff lives here now.

What's coming: essays about building with AI, write-ups on the projects I'm shipping, and links to the best things I'm finding. There's a lot in flight.

Welcome. Glad you're here.
