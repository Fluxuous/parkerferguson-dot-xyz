I've been meaning to do this for a long time.

Not in the way where you put it on a to-do list and feel guilty about it every Sunday. More like a low-grade awareness that I should probably have a place on the internet that's actually *mine* — not a social profile, not a consulting page, not someone else's platform.

So here it is. It's not done. The about page needs more words, the projects page is thin, and I haven't figured out what I actually want to write about yet. But it exists, and that's the part I kept getting stuck on.

I have a [consulting site](https://parkerferguson.co) that does a good job of saying "here's what I can do for you." But that's not the whole picture, and I've started to feel the gap. There's a lot of stuff I'm building, thinking about, and learning that doesn't have a natural home.

This is that home. I'm going to use it to share projects, write about things I'm interested in, and generally just put more of myself out there. We'll see how it goes.

The plan is to not overthink it.
