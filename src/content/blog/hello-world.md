This is the new parkerferguson.xyz. A place for me to put things on the internet.

The [consulting site](https://parkerferguson.co) is about what I can do for you. This site is about everything else — the projects, the writing, the weird experiments, the half-baked ideas that might turn into something.

More soon.
