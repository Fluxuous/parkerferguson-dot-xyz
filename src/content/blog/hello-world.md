I've wanted a real home on the internet for a long time — a place that's mine, not a social profile or a platform someone else controls. Somewhere to share what I'm building, write about what I'm learning, and connect the threads between twenty years of doing this work.

So here it is.

I have a [consulting site](https://parkerferguson.co) that's great at saying "here's what I can do for you." But there's a whole world of projects, ideas, and writing that doesn't fit there. This is the place for all of that — the experiments, the essays, the tools, the things I'm most excited about.

I'm going to use this space to build in public, share what I know, and put more of my work out into the world. There's a lot in flight and a lot more coming.

Welcome. Glad you're here.
