    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-text-secondary" style="line-height: 1.8;">
      I'm Parker. I build things with technology, and I've been doing it long
      enough to have strong opinions about what works and what doesn't — but
      hopefully not so long that I've stopped being curious.
    </p>

    <h2>The Short Version</h2>
    <p>
      Twenty-some years in tech. I've built trading systems at Two Sigma, scaled
      CoinDesk to 28 million readers, started companies, sold a few. I'm a
      generalist at heart — the kind of person who ends up at the intersection
      of engineering, product, and "wait, who's actually going to figure this out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now I'm deep in the weeds of agentic AI, building personal tools and
      systems, and trying to get better at sharing my work publicly. This site
      is part of that effort.
    </p>

    <h2>What I Actually Care About</h2>
    <p>
      I'm drawn to problems that sit at the edges — where technology meets
      human experience in ways that are messy and interesting. I like building
      things that help people think better, work better, and understand the
      world a little more clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also care a lot about craft. How things are made matters to me, not just
      whether they work. There's something deeply satisfying about a well-built
      system, and I think that care shows up in the output.
    </p>

    <h2>The Full Story</h2>
    <p>
      Still writing this part. The path has been winding enough that it deserves
      more than a few bullet points. For now, the
      <a href="https://parkerferguson.co">consulting site</a> has the professional
      highlights, and the <a href="/now">now page</a> has what I'm currently up to.
