    <!-- The 10-second version -->
    <p class="text-lg text-text-secondary">
      I'm Parker Ferguson. I've spent 20+ years building technology companies —
      from quantitative finance to media to AI. Currently exploring what's next.

    <h2>The Slightly Longer Version</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a generalist who's been lucky enough to work across wildly different
      domains. Trading systems at Two Sigma. Scaling CoinDesk to 28 million
      readers. Building and breaking things at startups. Three acquisitions along
      the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      These days I'm interested in agentic AI, creative systems, and the weird
      edges where technology meets human experience. I run a
      <a href="https://parkerferguson.co">consulting practice</a> helping founders
      build, scale, fix, and exit — but this site is about everything else.

    <h2>The Full Story</h2>
    <p class="text-text-muted italic">
      Coming soon. I'm working on a proper narrative that does justice to the
      winding path. In the meantime, the
      <a href="https://parkerferguson.co">consulting site</a> has the professional
      highlights.
