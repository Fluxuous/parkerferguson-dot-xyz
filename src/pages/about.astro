    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-text-secondary" style="line-height: 1.8;">
      I'm Parker. I build things with technology, and I've been doing it
      long enough to know that the most interesting problems are the ones
      that live at the edges between disciplines.
    </p>

    <h2>The Short Version</h2>
    <p>
      Twenty-some years in tech. I've built trading systems at Two Sigma,
      scaled CoinDesk to 28 million readers, started companies, and navigated
      three acquisitions. I'm a generalist by nature — the person who sits at
      the intersection of engineering, product, and strategy and connects the
      dots between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now I'm deep in agentic AI, building tools and systems that
      augment human creativity and decision-making. It's the most compelling
      design space I've encountered in two decades of doing this work.
    </p>

    <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm drawn to the places where technology amplifies what people are
      capable of. Tools that help you think more clearly. Systems that let
      a small team punch way above its weight. Interfaces that disappear
      and let you focus on the work that matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      I care deeply about craft — how things are made, not just whether
      they work. A well-built system has a kind of integrity to it, and
      that care compounds over time in ways that matter.
    </p>

    <h2>The Full Story</h2>
    <p>
      Coming soon — the path has been winding and rich, and it deserves
      a proper telling. For now, the
      <a href="https://parkerferguson.co">consulting site</a> has the
      professional highlights, and the <a href="/now">now page</a> has
      what I'm focused on today.
