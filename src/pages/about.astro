    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-text-secondary" style="line-height: 1.8;">
      I build technology and help other people build it better.
      Twenty years across finance, media, startups, and now AI.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Trading infrastructure at Two Sigma. Media platform at CoinDesk
      (1M to 28M monthly readers). Three startups, three acquisitions.
      Engineering and product leadership across all of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I consult for founders and run
      <a href="https://parkerferguson.co">MG Partners</a>, focused on
      AI-augmented products and workflows.

    <h2>This Site</h2>
    <p>
      A place for the work that doesn't fit on a consulting page.
      Projects, writing, links, experiments. More coming.
