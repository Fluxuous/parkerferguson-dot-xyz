    <h1>About</h1>

    <p class="text-lg text-text-secondary" style="line-height: 1.8;">
      I'm Parker. I build things with technology and I've been doing it
      for twenty years across industries that have almost nothing in common
      except that they all needed someone to figure it out.
    </p>

    <h2>The Short Version</h2>
    <p>
      I built trading platform infrastructure at Two Sigma, a $60B
      quantitative hedge fund. Scaled CoinDesk from a niche blog to
      28 million monthly readers. Started companies. Sold three of them.
      Led engineering and product teams from 1 person to 50+.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right now I'm building AI systems. Not chatbots. Systems that sit
      inside real workflows and make the people using them measurably
      better at their jobs. That's the problem I can't stop thinking about.
    </p>

    <h2>What Drives This</h2>
    <p>
      The best technology disappears. You don't notice it. You just notice
      that you're thinking more clearly, moving faster, catching things you
      would've missed. That's what I want to build.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a generalist. That's not a polite way of saying I can't commit.
      It means I've spent two decades learning how the pieces connect.
      Engineering, product, strategy, operations. The most interesting
      problems live in the gaps between those disciplines, and that's
      where I work.

    <h2>The Full Story</h2>
    <p>
      Coming soon. For now, the
      <a href="https://parkerferguson.co">consulting site</a> has the
      professional highlights. The <a href="/now">now page</a> has
      what I'm focused on today.
