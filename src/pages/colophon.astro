    <h1>Colophon</h1>
    <p>
      This site is built with <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>,
      styled with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>,
      and hosted on <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>. Content is
      written in Markdown and managed through Astro's content collections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The headings are set in <a href="https://github.com/cyrealtype/Lora">Lora</a>,
      a serif typeface that feels warm and readable. Body text is
      <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a>. Code is
      <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The design is intentionally quiet — fast, readable, with room to breathe.
      No tracking scripts, no cookie banners. Just the work.
