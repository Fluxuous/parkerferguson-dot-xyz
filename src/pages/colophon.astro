    <h1>Colophon</h1>
    <p>
      This site is built with <a href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>,
      styled with <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a>,
      and hosted on <a href="https://vercel.com">Vercel</a>. Everything
      is written in Markdown and managed through Astro's content collections.
    </p>
    <p>
      The headings are set in <a href="https://github.com/cyrealtype/Lora">Lora</a>,
      a serif typeface that feels warm without trying too hard. Body text is
      <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a>. Code is
      <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/">JetBrains Mono</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal was something that feels like a journal — quiet, readable,
      with room to breathe. No tracking, no analytics (yet), no cookie banners.
      Just words on a page.

      if you're curious how it all fits together.
