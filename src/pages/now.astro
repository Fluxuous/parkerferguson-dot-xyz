    <h2>Building</h2>
    <p>
      A few things in flight right now:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>This site.</strong> Finally putting a real home on the internet
        together. I've been meaning to do this for years and I'm just going to
        do it imperfectly and iterate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Manifest</strong> — a personal knowledge and productivity system
        I've been developing. It's opinionated, it's mine, and it's where a lot
        of my thinking about AI-augmented workflows lives.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exploring</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Agentic AI — not the hype, the actual "what can you build with this right now?" question</li>
      <li>What it looks like to share work publicly after years of building quietly</li>
      <li>The gap between how I think about myself and how I present myself to the world (turns out this is a whole thing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p class="italic text-text-muted">
      I'll fill this in once I stop context-switching long enough to finish something.
