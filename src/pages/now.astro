    <h2>Building</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>This site</strong> — a home base for everything I'm working on
        and thinking about. The beginning of a much larger web presence.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Manifest</strong> — a personal knowledge and productivity system
        built around AI-augmented workflows. It's opinionated, it's powerful,
        and it's where a lot of my ideas about the future of work come to life.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exploring</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Agentic AI — what you can actually build with it right now, and where it's going</li>
      <li>The craft of building in public — sharing work, writing, and connecting with people who care about the same things</li>
      <li>Creative systems that make individuals more capable</li>
    </ul>
