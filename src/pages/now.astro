    <h2>Building</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>This site.</strong> The beginning of a much bigger web presence.
        Everything I'm working on and thinking about, in one place.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Manifest</strong> — a personal knowledge and productivity system
        built on AI-augmented workflows. It's where most of my ideas about
        the future of work get tested in practice.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Exploring</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Agentic AI. Not the pitch deck version. What you can build with it today and where it breaks down.</li>
      <li>Creative systems that make one person as capable as a team.</li>
      <li>Building in public after years of building quietly.</li>
    </ul>
